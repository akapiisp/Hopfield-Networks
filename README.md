We study the Hopfield networks, which partially yielded the 2024 Nobel prize in physics, which are models for the brain. In particular, it explains the associative memory where the brain associates a memory to a given stimuli (e.g. red -> Christmas). We study whether non-symmetric networks are better for distinguishing between time separated stimuli compared to symmetric networks. In nature the synaptic connections are not symmetric.
